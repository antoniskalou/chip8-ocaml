A chip-8 virtual machine written in OCaml.

## Attributions

- Originally inspired by [caml8](https://github.com/linoscope/caml8), then I
did my own thing.
- The buzzer sound comes from [here](https://freesound.org/people/LittleRobotSoundFactory/sounds/270324/),
I couldn't be bothered sampling a sine wave.
